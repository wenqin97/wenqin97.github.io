# About Me
* I am a master's student graduated from [University of Chicago, Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu/). 
* My research interests lie in the general area of convex, nonlinear optimization, mathematical optimization, high-dimensional statistics and functional data analysis. 
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree at [Jilin University, Mathematics Department](https://math.jlu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm).

# High-dimensional Statistics Blog
We are holding a high-dimensional statistics reading group and this is our blog link for the group. We write about our understandings of the book $\textit{High-dimensional statistics a non-asymptotic viewpoint}$ by Wainwright, Martin J.
